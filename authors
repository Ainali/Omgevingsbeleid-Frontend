Omgevingsbeleid Frontend was originally created in order to meet the requirements
given by the new 'Omgevingswet' from the dutch national government.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made Omgevingsbeleid Frontend that much
better:

    Aiden Buis <hello@aidenbuis.com> - Front-end Developer
    Jason Kalmijn <Jason.kalmijn@effectivechanges.com> - Full Stack Developer    
    Coen van de Bovenkamp <cp.vande.bovenkamp@pzh.nl> - Product Designer
    Paulien Wan <p.wan@pzh.nl> - Test Consultant
    Bernard Vuijk <ber.vuijk@pzh.nl> - Projectmanager
    Jan Huntink <jjj.huntink@pzh.nl> - Testmanager
    Theo Geelen <t.geelen@pzh.nl> - Agile Coach
    Erik Verhaar <e.verhaar@pzh.nl> - Application Manager
    

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    The Provincie Zuid Holland who initiated the project.

    The Foundation for Public Code who helped us get this software open source and maintainable.

    All our testers, early users and fans.
