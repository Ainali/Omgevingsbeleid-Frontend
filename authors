Omgevingsbeleid Frontend was originally created in order to meet the requirements
given by the new 'Omgevingswet' from the dutch national government.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made Omgevingsbeleid Frontend that much
better:

    Aiden Buis <hello@aidenbuis.com>
    Jason Kalmijn <Jason.kalmijn@effectivechanges.com>
    Erik Verhaar <e.verhaar@pzh.nl>
    

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    The Provincie Zuid Holland who initiated the project.

    The Foundation for Public Code who helped us get this software open source and maintainable.

    All our testers, early users and fans.
